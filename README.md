# photo_copy
Copying images and videos from one location to another based upon extension and time.

## Purpose
To copy photos and videos to another location whilst creating some semblance of structure.

## May come back to do
* Recursive input folder search
* Removal of duplicate images (by contents rather than filename)
* User-defined sorting, i.e. something other than year and file extension
* Extension to other file types
* Addition of metadata etc. to create tags
